# Death N Taxes

My initial attempts at learning a little bit of game development.

I love Roguelikes and would one day like to make a full fledged one, this one is just to play around with.

Created following this tutorial: https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

Controls:
* WASD or arrow key movement
* G to interact with item under player
* C for character stats
* I for inventory
* V for action history
* R to raise a nearby corpse as a minion
